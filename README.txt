Features
Category Mapping: The program allows you to match different categories between Oxatis and BigCommerce, making it easier to align data with your existing BigCommerce store structure. Note: These changes have not yet been implemented, as they must be specific and unique to each e-commerce setup.

Custom Modifications: The program is highly adaptable and can be modified to include additional checks or transformations based on your requirements. Whether it's adjusting product descriptions, handling specific data fields, or implementing custom business logic, you can tailor the import process to meet your needs.
